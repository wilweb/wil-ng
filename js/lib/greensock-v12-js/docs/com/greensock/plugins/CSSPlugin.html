 With the help of the CSSPlugin, <b>GSAP can animate almost any css-related property</b> of DOM elements 
 including the obvious things like width, height, margins, padding, top, left, and more plus more interesting things like transforms 
 (rotation, scaleX, scaleY, skewX, skewY, x, y, rotationX, and rotationY), colors, opacity, and lots more. Load the CSSPlugin js 
 file to enable these capabilities and then make sure you define your values (in camel case form) inside a "css" property of 
 the <code>vars</code> parameter, like this:
 
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>
//notice the css-related values are inside the "css" object but the ease is not:
TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{top:"20px", left:"100px", backgroundColor:"#FF0000"}, ease:Power2.easeOut});
</pre></div>
 
               <p>
                  <i>
                     <b>Note:</b> a common mistake is to forget to wrap css-related properties in a css object which is essential for 
 specifying your intent. Remember, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) isn't just for tweening css properties. And always use camel case 
 representations of the properties, so instead of "font-size", you'd use "fontSize".</i>
               </p>
 
               <p>
                  <i>To get up and running quickly with GSAP, check out the <a href="http://www.greensock.com/jump-start-js/" target="external">Jump Start tour</a> 
 which covers the basics in a fun, interactive way. To see the CSS3-specific features (like 3D transforms, boxShadow, textShadow, borderRadius, and clip) 
 demonstrated and explained, see <a href="http://www.greensock.com/css3/" target="external">http://www.greensock.com/css3/</a>.</i>
               </p>
 
               <p>You can even define properties that are not generally tweenable and GSAP will apply the property for you (like 
 position:"absolute" or borderStyle:"solid"). These non-tweenable properties will be set at the beginning of the 
 tween (except <code>display:"none"</code> which will be applied at the end of the tween for obvious reasons).</p>
 
               <p>It is typically 
 a good idea to define a unit of measurement (like "24px" instead of "24" or "50%" rather than "50") but the default in most 
 cases is pixels (px), so you can omit the unit if you prefer. In fact, you can define your own defaults using the 
 <code>CSSPlugin.suffixMap</code> object. And even if the unit of measurement doesn't match the current one, GSAP will 
 attempt to convert them for you. So, for example, you could tween a width from "50%" to "200px".</p>
 
               <p>CSSPlugin can even animate complex values like <b>
                     <code>boxShadow:"0px 0px 20px 20px red"</code>
                  </b> and 
 <b>
                     <code>borderRadius:"50% 50%"</code>
                  </b> and <b>
                     <code>border:"5px solid rgb(0,255,0)"</code>
                  </b>. 
 When necessary, it attempts to figure out if the property needs a vendor prefix and applies it accordingly. There 
 may be a small subset of complex or bleeding-edge css properties that CSSPlugin can't handle yet, but the vast majority work great.</p>
 
               <p>In addition to almost all of the standard css properties, CSSPlugin recognizes some special ones that can be quite convenient:</p>
 
               <ul>
 	                <li>2D transforms: <b>rotation</b>, <b>scaleX</b>, <b>scaleY</b>, <b>scale</b>, <b>skewX</b>, <b>skewY</b>, 
 			<b>x</b>, and <b>y</b> - one of the most convenient things about the CSSPlugin is that it greatly simplifies transforms in the various 
 			browsers <b>including IE back through version 6!</b> No need to mess with various browser prefixes or funky matrix filters in IE. You can animate
 			2D transform properties inuitively:
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>//much simpler
TweenLite.to(element, 2, {css:{rotation:30, scaleX:0.8}});
</pre></div>
 
 By default, rotation, skewX, and skewY use degrees but you can use radians if you prefer. Simply append one of the standard suffixes ("rad" or "deg") like this:
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>//use "deg" or "rad"
TweenLite.to(element, 2, {css:{rotation:"1.25rad", skewX:"30deg"}});
</pre></div>
 
 To be clear, this is like setting the element's css to: <code>transform:rotate(1.25rad) skewX(30deg)</code> along with all the other browser prefix 
 values and the necessary IE filter which would be much more verbose. And CSSPlugin will affect the skewX/skewY values in a slightly different (arguably more intuitive) 
 way than some browsers because visually the object isn't stretched. For example, if you set <code>transform:skewX(85deg)</code> in the browser
 via CSS, the object would become EXTREMELY long (stretched) whereas with CSSPlugin, it would look more like it sheared in 3D space. Again
 this was a purposeful design decision because this behavior is more likely what animators desire. You can certainly get the same effect
 as the default browser behavior by tweening the scaleX/scaleY accordingly, using trigonometry.

                     <b>3D transforms</b>: in addition to all of the regular 2D properties (x, y, scaleX, scaleY, scale, rotation, skewX, and skewY) that work in almost all browsers, 
 			you can animate 3D properties too like <b>rotationX</b>, <b>rotationY</b>, <b>rotationZ</b> (identical to regular "rotation"), 
 			<b>z</b>, <b>perspective</b>, and <b>transformPerspective</b> in most modern browsers (see 
 			<a href="http://caniuse.com/transforms3d" target="external">http://caniuse.com/transforms3d</a> for details about browser support for 3D transforms). 
 			To see 3D transforms demonstrated visually in GSAP, see <a href="http://www.greensock.com/css3/" target="external">http://www.greensock.com/css3/</a>. Again, there is no need to use 
 			browser prefixes; CSSPlugin handles all of that for you under the hood. You can animate 3D transform properties and 2D properties (except skew) together inuitively:
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>
TweenLite.to(element, 2, {css:{rotationX:45, scaleX:0.8, z:-300}});
</pre></div>
 
 To get your elements to have a true 3D visual perspective applied, you must either set the <b>"perspective"</b> property of the parent element
 or set the special "transformPerspective" of the element itself (common values range from around 200 to 1000, the lower the number the 
 stronger the perspective distortion). The "transformPerspective" is like adding a <code>perspective()</code> directly inside the css "transform" style, like:
 <code>transform:perspective(500px) rotateX(45deg)</code> which only applies to that specific element whereas if you want to a 
 group of elements share a common perspective (the same vanishing point), you should set the regular "perspective" property on the
 parent/container of those elements. For more information about perspective, see <a href="http://desandro.github.com/3dtransforms/docs/perspective.html" target="external">this article</a>.
 
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>//apply a perspective to the PARENT element (the container) to make the perspective apply to all child elements (typically best)
TweenLite.set(container, {css:{perspective:500}});

//or set a default perspective that will be applied to every individual element that you tween in 3D:
CSSPlugin.defaultTransformPerspective = 500;

//or apply perspective to a single element using "transformPerspective"
TweenLite.set(element, {css:{transformPerspective:500}});
</pre></div>
 
 In regular CSS, the order that you list the transforms matters but GSAP always applies them in the same order for consistency: 
 scale, then rotation (same as rotationZ), then rotationY, then rotationX, then translation (x, y, z). If you want to rotate 
 the element around a point in 3D space other than its center, use the <code>transformOrigin</code> property (see below). 
 
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>//sample css:
.myClass {
    transform: scale(1.5, 1.5) rotateY(45deg) translate3d(10px, 0px, -200px)
}
 
//corresponding GSAP transform (tweened over 2 seconds):
TweenLite.to(element, 2, {css:{scale:1.5, rotationY:45, x:10, y:0, z:-200}});

//sample css that uses a perspective():
.myClass {
    transform: perspective(500px) rotate(120deg) translateY(50px)
}

//corresponding GSAP transform (set, not tweened):
TweenLite.set(element, {css:{transformPerspective:500, rotation:120, y:50}});
</pre></div>

                     <b>transformOrigin</b> - Sets the origin around which all transforms (2D and/or 3D) occur. By default, it is in the center 
 of the element ("50% 50%"). You can define the values using the keywords "top", "left", "right", 
 or "bottom" or you can use percentages (bottom right corner would be "100% 100%") or pixels. If, 
 for example, you want an object to spin around its top left corner you can do this:
 
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>//spins around the element's top left corner
TweenLite.to(element, 2, {css:{rotation:360, transformOrigin:"left top"}});
</pre></div>
 
                     <p>The first value in the quotes corresponds to the x-axis and the second corresponds to the y-axis, so to make the object transform 
 around exactly 50px in from its left edge and 20px from its top edge, you could do: </p>
 
                     <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>
//spins/scales around a point offset from the top left by 50px, 20px
TweenLite.to(element, 2, {css:{rotation:270, scale:0.5, transformOrigin:"50px 20px"}});
</pre></div>
 
 You can define a transformOrigin as a <b>3D value</b> by adding a 3rd number, like to rotate around the y-axis from
 a point that is offset 400px in the distance, you could do:
 
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>
//rotates around a point that is 400px back in 3D space, creating an interesting effect:
TweenLite.to(element, 2, {css:{rotationY:360, transformOrigin:"50% 50% -400px"}});

                           <i>CSSPlugin automatically works around a bug in Safari that causes 3D transformOrigin values to incorrectly act as though they affect translateZ(). To work around the bug, when you perform a 3D tween that has a transformOrigin with a non-zero z component (like <code>transformOrigin:"50% 50% -100px"</code>), CSSPlugin will record the z-component (-100px in this example) internally and remove it from the transformOrigin that gets applied to the css. Everything will render correctly because the z-axis origin offset is calculated internally and applied to the matrix3d(). Just keep in mind that if you check the css value of the transformOrigin after the tween has started, it won't have the z component but that's by design.</i>

                           <i>transformOrigin even works in Internet Explorer back to version 6 in 2D, although it is recommended that you set the element's position to "absolute" to avoid clipping.</i>

                     <b>shortRotation</b> - tweens the rotation property in the shortest direction. For example, if the element's rotation 
 is currently 170 degrees and you want to tween it to -170 degrees, a normal rotation tween would travel a total of 340 degrees in the 
 counter-clockwise direction, but if you use shortRotation, it would travel 20 degrees in the clockwise direction instead. Example:
 
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>TweenLite.to(element, 2, {css:{shortRotation:-170}});</pre></div>
 
 For 3D rotations, you may also use <code>shortRotationX</code> and <code>shortRotationY</code>.

                  <li>
                     <b>autoAlpha</b> - the same thing as "opacity" except that when the value hits "0", the 
 "visibility" property will be set to "hidden" in order to improve browser rendering performance and 
 prevent clicks/interactivity on the target. When the value is anything other than 0, "visibility" will be set to 
 "visible". And if the element's visibility is initially set to "hidden" and opacity is 1, it will assume opacity 
 should also start at 0. This makes it simple to start things out on your page as invisible (set your css visibility:hidden) 
 and then fade them in whenever you want.
 
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>//fade out and set visibility:hidden
TweenLite.to(element, 2, {css:{autoAlpha:0}});

//in 2 seconds, fade back in with visibility:visible
TweenLite.to(element, 2, {css:{autoAlpha:1}, delay:2});

                  <li>
                     <b>className</b> - allows you to morph between classes on an element. For example, let's say myElement has a class of "class1" currently and you want to change to "class2"  and animate the differences, you could do this:
 
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>TweenLite.to(myElement, 1, {css:{className:"class2"}});</pre></div>
 
                     <p>And if you want to ADD the class to the existing one, you can simply use the "+=" prefix. To remove a class, use the "-=" prefix like this:</p>
 
                     <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>TweenLite.to(myElement, 1, {css:{className:"+=class2"}});</pre></div>
 
                     <p>
                        <i>Note: there are some css-related properties that don't tween like IE filters and 3D transforms (support for those may come in the future).
  Also, there is a slight speed penalty when using className because the engine needs to loop through all of the css properties to see which 
 ones are different.</i>

                     <b>bezier</b> - Animate virtually any property (or properties) along a Bezier (curved) path which you define
 as an array of points/values that can be interpreted in several different ways, like as points through which a Bezier should 
 be drawn, or cubic or quadratic Bezier control and anchor points, etc. See the

 its features from within CSSPlugin. Here is an example of a bezier tween that makes an element curve through 3 points 
 using x and y transform properties and also automatically rotates it along the path as it goes:
 
 <div class="listing" version="3.0"><pre>TweenLite.to(element, 5, {css:{bezier:{curviness:1.25, values:[{x:100, y:200}, {x:250, y:400}, {x:500, y:50}], autoRotate:true}}, ease:Power1.easeOut});</pre></div>
 
                  </li>
 
                  <li>
                     <b>autoRound</b> - By default, CSSPlugin will round pixel values and zIndex to the closest integer during the tween (the inbetween 
 values) because it improves browser performance, but if you'd rather disable that behavior, pass <code>autoRound:false</code> in the css object. 
 You can still use the RoundPropsPlugin to manually define properties that you want rounded.</li>
 
               </ul>
